# Heart-Disease-Prediction
#### Heart Disease Prediction: Logistic Regression vs Random Forest This project analyzes the Heart Disease Prediction dataset to classify the presence of heart disease using two models: Logistic Regression (Linear Model) and Random Forest Classifier (Ensemble Model).

### ðŸ“Š The project involves :

**1. Data Exploration:**  Visualizations and insights from the dataset.

**2. Preprocessing:** Feature scaling and train-test splitting.

**3. Model Training:** Implementation of Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

**4. Evaluation:** Comparison of accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.

**5. Feature Importance:** Identification of significant features influencing predictions.

**6. Conclusion:** A detailed performance comparison to determine the best model.

### ðŸ“Œ Key Results :
**- Accuracy:** Random Forest achieved higher accuracy compared to Logistic Regression.

**- Feature Insights:** Significant features include age, cholesterol levels, and maximum heart rate.

### ðŸ›  Technologies Used :
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib
