# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Heart Disease Prediction: Logistic Regression vs Random Forest This project analyzes the Heart Disease Prediction dataset to classify the presence of heart disease using two models: Logistic Regression (Linear Model) and Random Forest Classifier (Ensemble Model).

## _The project involves :_

Data Exploration: Visualizations and insights from the dataset.

Preprocessing: Feature scaling and train-test splitting.

Model Training: Implementation of Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

Evaluation: Comparison of accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.

Feature Importance: Identification of significant features influencing predictions.

Conclusion: A detailed performance comparison to determine the best model.

## Key Results:
Accuracy: Random Forest achieved higher accuracy compared to Logistic Regression.

Feature Insights: Significant features include age, cholesterol levels, and maximum heart rate.

## Technologies Used:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib
